### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

**Before Submitting A Bug Report:**

* Check the [issues](https://github.com/username/chart_insights_system/issues) for a list of existing bugs. You might find that the issue you're facing has already been reported.
* Ensure you're using the latest version of the software.
* Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an issue with your environment setup.

Bugs are tracked as GitHub issues. Create an issue and provide the following information:

* Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
* Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details as possible.
* Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps.
* Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior.
* Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
* Include screenshots and animated GIFs which show you following the described steps and clearly demonstrate the problem.
* If the problem is related to performance or memory, include a CPU profile capture with your report.
* If the problem wasn't triggered by a specific action, describe what you were doing before the problem happened.
